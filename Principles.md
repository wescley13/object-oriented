## Principles

 - #### Encapsulation
    - Mechanism of binding the data together 
    - Hide from the outside world
    - Keep state private
    - Acess only public functions

- ### Abstraction
    - Natural extension of encapsulation 
    - Hinding all but the relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity
    - Helps hinding internal implemetation  details
    - only reveling operations that are important to other objects

- ### Inheritence
    - Mechanism of createing new classes of existing ones

- ### Polymorphism
    - Ability of an object to take different forms
    - Respond to the same message with different ways
    - Example: Chess Game - Pieces can take many forms / All respond to differently the "move" message
        - Bishop
        - Castle
        - Knight
